Hello fellow earthlings!

This is a tweakable 2 (or 1) player snake game that I coded with python pygame library to try out machine learning on. Specifically I chose NEAT algorithm, since it seemed elegant, well documented and most importantly I found it cool that it's so similar to evolution.

This is the result:

I started out from this example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD4qAhfFuLo for snake part of code and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2&index=1 for overview of NEAT functionality and upgraded/polished the code to suit my needs.
Best place to consult in case something goes awry is still the documentation of respective modules.
