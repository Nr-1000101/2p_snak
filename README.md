# 2Psnake
2 (or 1) player snake game that I coded with python pygame library to try out machine learning on.

I started out from this guys example + some other tutorials and upgraded it to suit my needs (I recommend checking it out if you are confused about parts of this code): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD4qAhfFuLo

Feel free to do anything with this.
