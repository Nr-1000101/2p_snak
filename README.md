# 2Psnake

Hello fellow earthlings!

This is a tweakable 2 (or 1) player snake game that I coded with python pygame library to try out machine learning on.

I started out from this guys example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD4qAhfFuLo (I recommend checking it out if you are confused about parts of this code) + some other tutorials and upgraded it to suit my needs.

You might need to install pygame to run this (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). 

There is a ton of guides on this already so I didn't do much documentation but I hope function and variable names help to identify what does what. 

Also feel free to do anything with this.
